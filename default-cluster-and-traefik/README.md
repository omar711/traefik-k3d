# Default Cluster / Traefik

This config assumes that Traefik has been deployed by default during the k3d install.  

We set up ingresses for a pair of webservers, plus a chisel server.

This largely follows the opening sections of the blog post at: https://traefik.io/blog/traefik-proxy-kubernetes-101/
