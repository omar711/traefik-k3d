# Attempt to manually configure Traefik

Note: I didn't succeed with this path, but have saved the config for future reference.  This comes from following the guide at https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/quick-start-with-kubernetes/ 

It's assumed that the k3d cluster was installed without the bundled version of Traefik.
